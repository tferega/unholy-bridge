# Javascript to Java Unholy Bridge Tools
Javascript seems to be able to interface with Java Applets in some pretty
suprising ways.

This project provides some simple tools to do so. It currenty has only a few
functions which I need, but I may update it in the future.
Also, I may be writing a tutorial, if there is an interest.


## Capabilities
As far as I've seen, Javascript can do the following, given a Java applet
embedded in the page:

  * Access public members in the applet.
  * Access all of the Java standard library.
  * Instantiate Java classes.

In other words, you can use the full power of Java in your Javascript.
